***Growing Use of Sustainable Material for IV Fluid Monitoring Devices to Boost the Growth of Global IV Fluid Monitoring Devices Market*** 

The global market for IV fluid monitoring devices market is projected to grow on account of the rising use of sustainable materials for IV fluid monitoring devices. Biodegradable materials have made it possible to utilize sensors that would decompose naturally after usage, which presents a huge opportunity to revolutionize healthcare technologies. These materials can be used to create implantable electrical devices that decrease chronic inflammatory reactions, don't need to be removed, and offer promising future directions for biomedical technology. Biodegradable materials and eco-friendly sensor systems have a lower carbon footprint and produce less medical and electronic waste, which can help alleviate some of the most urgent environmental issues. Consequently, the market for IV fluid monitoring devices is expected to grow. 

Additionally, COVID-19 demonstrated the value of telemedicine. Technology has proved very useful in ensuring patient continuity through remote consultation, continuous monitoring, and patient education by phone and videoconferencing in the setting of the coronavirus disease. IV fluid transfer devices will be used in telemedicine systems going forth. The advent of remote monitoring and consultations has made accessibility and convenience for patients feel like vital elements of healthcare delivery. As a result, it is anticipated that market demand will rise during the ensuing years.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global IV fluid monitoring devices market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

- Rising Prevalence of Hospital Acquired Infection 
- Growing Geriatric Population 

***Challenges:***

Due to the abundance of domestic and foreign suppliers, there is fierce rivalry in the market. Renowned global suppliers encounter intense rivalry from small local suppliers offering same goods at much reduced costs, even with their vast distribution networks and partnerships with premier medical centres and hospitals. Additionally, customers have the option to purchase luxury goods at a discount. The market is volume-driven and price-sensitive. Price wars are emerging from the intense competition among providers. Vendors are focusing on reducing the price of their goods to boost sales volume in an attempt to stay competitive in the market. At the moment, the leading suppliers have very narrow profit margins. 

By end-user the market for IV fluid monitoring devices is segmented into hospitals & clinics, ASCs, and home care. Out of these, the hospitals & clinics segment is set to gather the highest share of about 50% over the forecast period. However, the home care segment is set to grow. The increasing frequency of chronic diseases like cancer has led to an increase in home-based therapies using medical devices like infusion therapy devices. Long hospital visits and significant medical expenses are avoided when treating chronic diseases with home infusion therapy devices, which provide safe, accurate, and precise drug delivery based on the patient's demands. The market is expanding due to the growing trend of home-care infusion pumps having wireless and remote programming capabilities. These features enable chemists and clinicians to monitor and establish pharmaceutical dose settings and reduce the frequency of hospital visits. 

By region, the market for IV fluid monitoring devices in Asia Pacific is also estimated to rise over the forecast period. This was mostly ascribed to the aging population, the introduction of novel medical technologies, the increasing incidence of chronic illnesses including diabetes, cancer, and arthritis, and the rise in healthcare costs.
