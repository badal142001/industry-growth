***Rising Application in Molecular Biology Application to Promote Global Market Share of Magnetic Beads Market***

The global magnetic beads market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increased usage in medical applications, DNA & RNA extraction methods, bioassays, and life sciences applications. Other than this, rising incidences of tumors and cancer are also propelling the demand for magnetic beads, especially for leukemia. It has been estimated that in the United States, a total of 184,721 people were diagnosed with leukemia. The magnetic beads are considered to help separate the cells and remove cell tumors from the bone marrow and isolate the lymphoid cells from the blood film. On the back of this, the global magnetic beads market is projected to flourish in the forecasted period. Other than this, research related to the microbiomes has become prominent in recent years. The increase in investment in microbiological and genetic research over a prolonged period is projected to boost the demand for the product remarkably. The usage of these beads will accelerate more research-based investigations will be conducted throughout, to discover new therapeutic methods worldwide. Furthermore, the demand for magnetic beads market is projected to expand on the back of the rising production of healthcare products. The rise in the trend of POC which is the point of care in the laboratories as well as at the door of patients is projected to raise the usage of magnetic beads. 

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global magnetic beads market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

- Rising Research Spending is Augmenting the Demand 
- Increased Usage of Magnetic Beads in Medicated Wearables 

***Challenges:***

Factors such as a decrease in magnetic force with the rise in distance, exorbitant price of magnetic beads, and less research in the development of magnetic beads are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of the global magnetic beads market.

By application, the global magnetic beads market is segmented into cell separation & cell expansion, exosome analysis, protein sample prep and protein isolation, IVD assay development, and nucleic acid isolation. Out of these, the IVD assay development segment will rise the most during the forecast period and is projected to garner revenue of almost 50%.

By region, the Europe magnetic beads market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2036. The market is projected to flourish because of the rising demand for diagnostic and therapeutic solutions.
