***Growing Need for Industrial Wastewater Treatment to Promote Global Market Share of Spoolable Pipes***

The global spoolable pipes market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increasing demand for wastewater treatment. The methods used to clean wastewater that has been tainted by industrial activity fall under the category of industrial wastewater treatment which is predicted to grow as worries about environmental safety and knowledge of better drinking water quality develop. Industrial wastewater is frequently highly contaminated and is often cleaned by two common industrial wastewater treatment techniques including chemical treatment and mechanical filtration. Chemical precipitation is the chemical treatment technique that is most frequently used whereby an acid or alkali is added during the chemical precipitation process. Various kinds of pipes including spoolable pipes are utilized in the treatment facility for water, wastewater, chemicals, and mixes which are frequently transported from buildings to the wastewater treatment facility. Moreover, spoolable pipes are a wonderful alternative for applications in industries like water and wastewater to repair damaged sewer lines and stop poisonous water from leaking dangerously.

Additionally, the growing importance of sustainability across the globe is expected to create a huge demand for spoolable pipes. Encouraging sustainability contributes to the improvement of surroundings, and also aids in the protection of natural resources like energy and water while also lowering pollution. Spoolable pipes support environmental sustainability as they are lightweight by design, and require fewer protective coatings that could be harmful to the environment.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global spoolable pipes market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

- Surge in Production of Oil and Gas
- Rising Development of Efficient Piping Products

***Challenges:***

The unavailability of raw materials required for the production of spoolable pipes, and the stringent regulations developed by the government are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of spoolable pipes. Advanced composites such as carbon fiber, which is regarded as high-performance materials are aspects, are used to make spoolable pipes, however, its production is energy-intensive and cannot be recycled or remelted, which is creating a severe global scarcity. 

By matrix, the global spoolable pipes market is segmented into thermoplastics and thermosets. The thermoplastics segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2036 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. A more flexible option for gas extraction is provided by reinforced thermoplastic pipe (RTP) which is currently widely accepted as an alternative to steel, owing to its properties including lightweight, easy to spool, and resistant to rust.

Additionally, by end-user on-shore segment is expected to garner a notable share. The onshore oil and gas sector has made extensive use of spoolable pipes, as they can be used in high-pressure applications such as water injection lines, water-alternating gas lines, production gathering lines, gas lift injection lines, and portable well test lines. Whereas, in the offshore sector, spoolable composite tubing may also be used in the removal of hydrate blockages. 

Furthermore, by reinforcement, the gas fiber reinforcement segment is set to garner a significant share as it is extensively being utilized in pipelines for the collection and distribution of natural gas and as a complementary or replacement material in high-pressure transmission lines.

By region, the Middle East & Africa spoolable pipes market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2036. This growth is anticipated by higher production of oil in the region. For instance, in 2022, the Middle East produced more than 30 million barrels of oil per day. Gas and oil resources are abundant in the Middle East which possesses over 25% of the world's oil production. These factors are expected to drive the demand for spoolable pipes in the region.

This report also provides the existing competitive scenario of some of the key players of the global spoolable pipes market which includes company profiling of Baker Hughes Co., TechnipFMC plc, Wienerberger AG, Flexpipe Modular Material Handing System, FlexSteel Pipeline Technologies Inc, Future Pipe Industries, Victrex Plc, Cosmoplast Ind. Co. LLC, Hebei Heng An Tai Pipeline Co. Ltd., and others, and others.
