***Increasing Investments in LiDAR Startups to Drive Growth of the Global LiDAR* *Market***

The primary drivers of the global demand for LiDAR systems are the increasing usage of LiDAR in UAVs and the growing application of LiDAR technology in the automobile industry. By detecting items in their immediate proximity, LiDAR technology enables autonomous vehicles to make informed decisions. Automakers are utilizing this concept in their attempts to develop safe autonomous vehicles. An automobile can utilize LiDAR to find its direction. LiDAR technology creates a three-dimensional (3D) image of the surrounding area by identifying object distances depending on the position of the self-driving car. An integrated computer system determines the distance that light travels by timing the interval between the initial laser pulses and the receiver.

The development of autonomous vehicles makes use of LiDAR technology to help materialize the notion while guaranteeing safety. A LiDAR system maps its environment in three dimensions by using laser pulses. These lasers leave no evidence behind for the unaided eye to find. LiDAR helps autonomous vehicles—which prioritize safety above all else—make precise, error-free decisions that reduce the likelihood of collisions. In 2019, some 31 million cars worldwide were running partially or fully automated. It is projected that the population of the country would surpass 54 million by 2024.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global LiDAR Market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

- Growing Use of LiDAR in Building and Civil Engineering
- The Use of LiDAR Systems in UAVs Is Growing

***Challenges:***

LiDAR drones give experts in a variety of industries accurate, high-resolution data so they can make wise decisions. LiDAR drone service costs can be difficult to predict, thus prospective customers should be informed of all the variables that could influence the ultimate cost. These variables include the survey region, the type of LiDAR sensor being used, data processing and analysis, the service provider's experience and knowledge, and the necessary level of information accuracy. A significant portion of the market's slow expansion might be attributed to numerous price obstacles. Drones with LiDAR equipment are more expensive than those with photogrammetry equipment because LiDAR needs more specialized parts and more advanced technology. LiDAR technology measures distances using laser beams and produces an extremely precise three-dimensional representation of the surroundings. The need for a specialized LiDAR sensor, which can cost more than the camera used by photogrammetry drones, limits the market's potential for expansion. High LiDAR service cost is expected to hamper the market growth. 

The global LiDAR market is segmented into product, technology and application, where product is sub-segmented into airborne LiDAR, ground-based LiDAR, UAV LiDAR, solid state LiDAR. By the end of 2035, the airborne LiDAR segment is anticipated to garner the largest revenue of USD 11.53 billion with a CAGR of 24.4% over the forecast period. The main purpose of this technology is to produce a digital elevation model of the landscape in three dimensions while the airplane is in flight. The processing and distribution of 3D point clouds have seen the biggest advancements in aerial LiDAR technology recently. Developments in lightweight drone sensors have coincided with the rise of drone autonomy. However, a significant amount of money has been invested in automating cloud-based processing and storage, leading to a noticeable reduction in delivery times. The revenue of the global drone market fluctuated from 2018 to 2023. For instance, there was an almost 10% rise in 2023 compared to the previous year. Forecasts indicate that the drone industry will expand over the next years, with a projected value of 4.68 billion US dollars by 2028.

Over the forecast period of 2023-2035, the Asia Pacific LiDAR market is predicted to develop at a CAGR of 25.5%. The Asia Pacific market was worth USD 0.30 billion in 2022, and it is expected to be worth USD 5.62 billion by the end of 2035. The main factors propelling market expansion in the region are growing awareness of forest management and an increase in surveying and mapping operations brought on by increased infrastructure development. The government in the area is developing the infrastructure for surveys in a variety of ways, from building bridges and highways to mapping massive retail developments that are driving the market. At an estimated cost of USD 338 million, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) intends to build new airports as well as extend and renovate several existing airports over the course of the next four to five years.
