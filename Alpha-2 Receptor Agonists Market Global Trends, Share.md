The global [alpha-2 receptor agonists market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/alpha-2-receptor-agonists-market/3265) is projected to grow with a moderate CAGR during the forecast period, i.e., 2024-2036 on account of the rising number of incidences of hypertension worldwide** and the growth in applications of alpha-2 receptor agonists. *The World Health Organization observed that 1.13 billion people in the world had hypertension in 2019, out of which two-thirds of the population was living in low and middle-income countries*. Furthermore, alpha-2 receptor agonists are also deployed as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy for change of behavior in children suffering from attention-deficit disorder, which is a significant factor for the growth in use of these drugs in the future.

The market is segmented by use into hypertension, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), pain & panic disorders, ICU & procedural sedation, and others. Among these segments, the hypertension segment is anticipated to hold the largest share during the forecast period ascribing to the growing prevalence of hypertension globally. Moreover, by distribution channel, the hospital pharmacies segment is expected to grow at a significant rate as a substantial share of the population with hypertension and related disorders prefer hospital facilities for treatment.

On the basis of region, the global alpha-2 receptor agonists market is segmented into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East & Africa, out of which, Asia Pacific’s market is projected to grow at the highest CAGR throughout the forecast period owing to the rising occurrence of hypertension among the population in the region. Additionally, the market in North America is assessed to hold the largest share over the coming years owing to the high incidences of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the region. 

**Increasing Prevalence of Hypertension Globally and** **Growing Applications of Alpha-2 Receptor Agonists to Drive Market Growth**

*According to the data published by the World Health Organization in 2021, an estimated 17.9 million deaths are caused annually due to cardiovascular diseases in the world.* 

The rapid growth in ageing population and the changes in lifestyle patterns have given way to the prevalence of various hypertension-related disorders among the population on a global scale which has steered the demand for alpha-2 receptor agonists over the last few years. In addition, escalating number of applications of alpha-2 receptor agonists for ICU and procedural sedation is also expected to boost the market growth in upcoming years. 

However, stringent regulatory procedures for medicine approval and harmful effects caused by the continuous use of alpha-2 receptor agonists are some of the factors that are estimated to restrain market growth during the forecast period.
