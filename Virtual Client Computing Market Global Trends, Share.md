***Growth Drivers:***

- Surge in Demand for an Agile Workforce
- Rising Danger of Data Theft and Loss

***Challenges:***

The rising concern for risks associated with mobility and cost-control in virtual client computing, and the compliance limitation are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of virtual client computing. One of the primary issues projected to hinder market growth is mobility and cost control challenges. For instance, problems related to antivirus, botting, and login make it difficult to provide access to a large population in a virtualized environment in a single instance.

By solution, the global virtual client computing market is segmented into virtual user sessions (VUS), virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI), and terminal services. The virtual user sessions (VUS) segment is to garner a highest revenue by the end of 2036 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The growth can be attributed to the rising popularity of VUS desktops. For instance, organizations often employ VUS desktops to give remote access to applications and data in a regulated and centralized environment, and with the usage of virtual client computing, users can access their systems from different places, providing flexibility.

By end use industry, the global virtual client computing market is segmented into BFSI, retail, healthcare, manufacturing, and IT & telecom. The growth can be attributed to the growing preference for remote work. For instance, virtual client computing is an important component for the IT industry since it enables remote work while preserving efficiency and effective communication. The number of remote job opportunities will expanded by more than 1000% by 2021. A recent poll found that more than 45% of respondents chose cloud-enabled tools and technology to support remote teams in 2021, with an emphasis on digital communication tools.

By region, the North America virtual client computing market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2036. This growth is anticipated by growing popularity of cloud-based technologies. For instance, the United States and Canada are progressively embracing cloud computing and experiencing significant technological developments as a result of the existence of key market participants such as Oracle, Google, and others. The increased adoption of cloud-based technologies has increased demand for virtual client computing in the area, as it provides consumers with the computer resources they require, which can be conveniently accessed via virtual servers. 

By region, the Asian Pacific virtual client computing market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2036. This growth is anticipated by rising number of small & medium enterprises. For instance, to improve corporate productivity and decrease the need for costly hardware updates, SMEs in the region are adopting virtual client computing, which provides access to virtual desktops at a lower cost.
